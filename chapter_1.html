<h1>The Forest Poets</h1>

<h2>Chapter One - Aquitane</h2>

<p>The marketing of the Corporate City of Aquitane showcased a perpetually gleaming city.  Attractive, well-dressed people smiled contentedly as they walked arm in arm along pristine streets.  The promise these advertisements held out was of a life perfected, available to all with the resources to invest.</p>

<p>The citizens of Aquitane assumed the constant markering of the city was aimed at the visitors and potential investors.  They never questioned if it might also be aimed at them.  All their life they had been taught by repetition to identify as Aquitanians, so much so that they no longer noticed the indoctrination.  It probably wouldn't have mattered if they were aware of it, for as clearly exaggerated as the marketing was, they needed to believe it because it made made them feel better about themselves.  Aquitanians were the best people, therefore they were amongst the best people.   Aquitane was the best city in the world, and by good fortune that's where they lived.  It was a mix of lies and exaggerations to anyone who cast a critical eye over it, but they were comforting lies and exaggerations, and neither the marketers nor the residents had any inclination to unmask themselves.</p>

<p>Although he'd lived in Aquitane all his life, Dheran couldn't recognise his own life in the marketing advertisements.  Nor come to think of it the life of many of the people he knew.  When he wandered those very same streets featured in the marketing.  Some of the people he saw did seem happy, some were attractive, some well dressed, but certainly not all of them, not even a majority.  Hardly anyone strolled along arm in arm staring contentedly at each other.  Rather most of the people seemed preoccupied with more pressing things than strolling.  They rushed around, often with serious looks, doing something that seemed of the utmost importance.  Dheran couldn't help but notice many actually frowned their way from place to place, thinking what he didn't now but they clearly weren't positive thoughts, some of them even looked quite angry.</p>

<p>Still Dheran was sure there were at least a few people, maybe even a lot of people lived that perfect life.  If he just had a bit of luck, maybe a promotion, he might even join them, maybe one day he'd even be featured on an advertisement.  And in any case even if it wasn't perfect in Aquitane, he knew it was better than anywhere else.  It was the best place, with the best people after all.</p>

<p>To an objective observer, Aquitane might be described as a large but otherwise indistinct city, a city that closely resembled every other corporate city.  Along its streets lay the same shops, selling the same brands, the same caf√©s served the same drinks, the same sorts of restaurants served the same sorts of food.  Like all cities they had invested in the requisite sports stadium covered in the same advertising.  The streets were clean, orderly, with a well maintained park here and there to break the monotony of glass, concrete and metal.  In a few central streets of the city expensive public art dotted the street scape, hinting to all that this was where the money changed hands.</p>

<p>Despite this lack of uniqueness the citizens of Aquitane always maintained a fierce pride in their city.  They felt themselves prouder of Aquitane than the citizens of the other cities were of theirs, and they showed it.  They turned up en masse to parades for just about anything the city thought worthy of a parade, they wore uniform colours and cheered at miscellaneous events where teams or individuals from Aquitane were involved, they bought things for each other on the days they were told to buy things for each other, and the days which honoured their heroes living and dead were especially popular occasions.  They were Aquitanians, somehow different and better than other people, and the honour and identity of their city was inseparable to their own.</p>

<p>Dheran's contentment with Aquitane wasn't troubled by the fact that he hadn't been anywhere else.  He had picked up some things here and there about the other cities, and he wasn't very impressed.  Although the marketing of other Corporate Cities looked remarkably similar to that of Aquitane, Dheran knew in his bones that Aquitane had an intangible quality, friendlier perhaps, more upstanding maybe.  He wasn't quite sure but he knew that somehow they were special and as one of them he was special too.</p>

<p>If he wasn't as happy as the people in the marketing brochures he figured that was probably his own doing.  He was shy around people, felt a little awkward in his conversation skills, and whilst there were people who were happy enough to spend time with him, he didn't feel secure in their friendship.  For instance if he fell ill for a long time they probably wouldn't go out of their way to visit often, or bring him soup etc.  If he mentioned this to people they were always shocked that he felt that way, and protested.  It was nice for them to protest but over time he couldn't help but notice a lot of those people had fallen out of his life all the same.  He didn't really hold it against them, they were probably sincere when they said it, but he probably hadn't lived up to their expectations for what their friendship should be.</p>

<p>Given this he didn't expect adulation, rather he hoped people would think he was a nice, normal guy.  As for his future he didn't have any grand pretensions that he was going to be "somebody", just getting along OK, having a decent life was enough to aspire to.  Internally though he didn't quite know how to be the "normal" person everyone else seemed to effortlessly be.  Many of his needs went unfilled and his inter personal relationships weren't all he wished them to be, but his life wasn't terrible.  It wasn't suffering, rather a vague sort of unsatisfactoriness.</p>

<p>He felt he had little control over his circumstances, and realised it was related to the way he perceived himself.  He tried to count his blessings as much as possible, and there were many things to be grateful for.  He was competent at his job, his life was comfortable, he could buy most of the products he needed or wanted, his health was generally good, he had his family around him and their stock price was respectable and on a gradual rise.  Dheran had managed to eke out a life in some ways routine and without great highs, but it was more bearable than any other that seemed realistically achievable.  He was risk averse of course, so as much as he might have a vague hope of something more for himself, he didn't want to risk it and lose the certainty and small pleasures his life did give him.</p>

<p>If he did start to feel sorry for himself, he just had to remember that a lot of people were worse off than him.  He just had to look out over the Aquitane city walls to see that.  He'd never actually looked out over the city walls, he'd always meant to but didn't really see the point, he knew well enough what was out there, that it wasn't good.</p>

<p>Dheran worked as a computer programmer in the austere but clean down-town offices of the Corporate City of Aquitane.  He was paid well, not excessively well, but enough to meet all his needs if not those of his ego.  He believed he was good at his job and at his yearly evaluations this was confirmed by a tick of "satisfactory" performance and the scheduled two and a half percent bonus.  His bonus had been the same two and a half percent every year he had been in the job, he wasn't really sure what it was a bonus for, but he was always happy to receive it.  The main benefit was that he liked telling his friends and family he had received his bonus, it sounded like he had achieved something impressive at work.</p>

<p>He worked in a corporation, though this didn't tell you much as pretty much every entity in Aquitane was a corporation of some sort.   Like most corporations in Aquitane his work helped provide services to other corporations.  Each was slightly different and Dheran enjoyed that small amount of variation in his job, and he especially liked helping people.  People often told him he was an up and coming employee in the department, though he felt he had been up and coming for some time now and didn't seem to be on top of anything or gone anywhere significant yet.  The recognition everyone told him he deserved was just around the corner he thought, so he kept working, doing what he was told.  The companies stock price was good, as was his family's and everyone acknowledged that he played his part.</p>

<p>Dheran's department at work, Corporate Communication Services, was run by a middle aged woman called Monique.  As far as anyone could tell work was the all encompassing centre of her life.  Her unblinking gaze fell upon on everything their department did, and she expected everyone to take their work as seriously as she did hers.  Dheran passively studied her trying to find some glimmer of a personality beyond her stern work exterior, but so far he had seen no evidence of a softer side or even a life outside the walls of the office.  When office talk turned to families and children, she would proclaim "My team are my children", with a terse attempt at a smile that for some reason made Dheran a little sad.  He never quite felt at ease with Monique, she had a lot of power over his life and he couldn't help feeling she was always judging him and not entirely favourably either.  It seemed like she was waiting for him to slip up, saying or doing something which would reflect badly on himself and the corporation, and this would effect his career, maybe even his family's share price.  Despote his lack of confidence in his own people skills, he did have confidence in his work, he was better than most the people around him, he was pretty sure of that at least.  One day he hoped Monique would see the light, finally he would go from up and coming, to arisen and arrived.  He didn't really know how that was going to change his life, but it was a goal at least, it gave him something to be working towards.  Once his work and his personal life fell into place, he would finally be where he belonged, on the front cover of a marketing brochuer strolling arm and arm with someone staring contentedly at each other.</p>

<p>Dheran had arrived at work early that morning, and it was finally nearing the end of a productive but mentally tiring day.  Too late to start any new tasks of significance, too early to sneak off home, he looked for ways to bide time.  He ordered some papers on his desk, checked his messages, looked over his coming appointments and reordered his papers again.  He hated having to look busy, the falsity of it, but he also knew how important good impressions were.  Success within the corporation depended more on how one was perceived to be, than on how one actually was.  Everyone knew that and for the most part seemed to be OK with it.  Dheran had tried discussing it with his colleagues a few times, the fakeness of the system, and they gave him a look as if to say he was a fool for even thinking about questioning it.  "You're not going to change it" was generally the response people gave him when he questioned things, and he knew they were right.</p>

<p>The knowledge that he had two days of vacation to follow wasn't helping the interceding seconds between now and finishing time go any faster.  He started to feel an angst that he was trapped in time and space, and this was only exacerbated by his compulsive checking of the time, a few seconds passing here and there.  He looked around hoping for something else to occupy him and break the monotony.  He watched jealously as one by one his fellow employees, the ones that got here earlier than him, filed out of the building.  The office gradually became quieter, darker and emptier.  Some of them acknowledged him with a nod, a raised eyebrow, a half smile, or a wave as they went past, which gave Dheran a chance to make conversation and use up some seconds.  He asked leading questions, "Anything planned on the weekend" or "Looking forward to a break?".  He had mixed results with this, most of them seemed gave him short perfunctory answers.  Clearly they were keener to edge their way out of the conversation and thus the door, than to chat with him.  A couple of politer ones mercifully used up a couple of minutes, and Dheran was grateful to them.  A number of his colleagues just trundling past him without a word or even looking up, so Dheran resented them.  "How much effort is it to wave goodbye, to show a little kindness" he thought to himself?  Anyway in some ways he felt sorry for most of these sorts of people, the way they got up and walked out it seemed like the prospect of going home or staying at work was equally empty to them.</p>

<p>Finally the tedium was broken with something very interesting.  He had a message from his new friend, well he was pretending to treat her as a friend but in his mind she was actually a love interest.  Her name was Maiya and they had met by chance recently and she had charmed him immediately, for the last few days becoming Dheran's main recurring thought. Dheran never women randomly, he was far too shy to apporach anyone, and few women seemd inclined to approach him but Maiya had been a notable exception.</p>

<p>He had been on his way to play his guitar with a group of musicians who regularly met in a park.  Waiting for a train he noticed her immediately as she walked past and sat on a seat nearby.  Her pretty eyes looked over at him and then up and down at his guitar case, and asked him if it was an instrument.  It was a big square road case so he tried to make a joke about it being a his briefcase, and she just frowned at him.  Trying to quickly recover the situation he said "Oh I was trying to make a joke, actually it's my guitar".  "So you play" she asked with a smile which since that moment had kept flashing through Dheran's mind.  He nodded awkwardly, she smiled again and they soon found himself in a lively chat.  When his train came he pretended it wasn't the right one.  When her train came he realised he could take it a couple of stops along the way to where he was going so he got on.  They talked first about music and then somehow the conversation ranged to food, Dheran mentioned he like to cook and she seemed impressed with this.  They got off at the same stop, and Dheran told her he had to wait for another train, and she stayed with him, and Dheran couldn't help noticing how she was quite happy to keep talking to him.</p>
<p>Maiya seemed to remember the time and said she had somewhere to be.  Dheran thought perhaps she had finally noticed whatever it was that was wrong with him that kept him single.  Her beautiful smile remained unchanged however and she started asking him a number of short sharp, not obviously connected questions about himself, one after the other almost like an interrogation.  "Where do you work?", "Do you like Aquitane?", "What did he think of the corporate cities?", "What business is your family in?" etc.   Dheran tried to answer as quickly as she asked, she gave him no time to be polite and fit in any questions about her.  Eventually she made to leave, Dheran was almost grateful because he was now running late and would have no choice but to get on a train he had said wasn't his only 15 minutes earlier.   Dheran tried to pluck up the courage to ask to see her again, it was totally out of character for him to do so, but this wasn't a situation, this wasn't a woman, he could just let slip.  There was something about her, a sparkle in her eyes, the way she leaned in and touched him, the way she smiled when she spoke.  "Ask her" he almost shouted to himself in his head, willing himself on with the foreshadowing of regret if he didn't.  Maiya was very much controlling the conversation though, before he could ask Maiya, without pausing from her previous sentence, handed him a hand written note with her details, like she already had them ready to give to him.  She looked up into his eyes as she did so with a beckoning smile that paralysed him for a moment.  She noticed his mute silence and took it as some sort of hesitation or unwillingess, "Oh I didn't mean to force you, I'm really quite nice", she smiled sweetly as evidence.  "No no" he stuttered regaining a little control, "That would be great".  "Say something else" he thought to himself, so forcing an awkward smile he said "Great, really great".  She half turned to go in a way was both charming, elegant and effortless, that said she hadn't noticed how awkward he was.  It was one of those physical manipulations that women seem to have perfected to the delight and mystification of men, and over her shoulder she said the parting words that fell onto Dheran's soul like rain onto sandy parched earth "Seeing as you like to cook you should invite me around for dinner sometime".  He nodded, waved and watched her turn and walk away unable to take his eyes off her.  When she turned to exit the platform she turned and saw him standing there stunned still looking at her, she sort of half smiled, half giggled and then she was gone.</p>

<p>Dheran smiled and shook his head to himself, reading over her details in his hand.  His train came soon, and then practise, but his thoughts stayed on those brief moments, replaying them over in his mind, they stayed with him into the night, they greeted him when he awoke.  How soon is too soon to get in touch, he thought to himself, when really he wished the conversation had never ended at all.</p>

<p>It was mid morning on the following day, when he had stopped worrying it was too soon to get in touch, and started worrying that he had waited too long, when he plucked up the courage to send her a message asking her to dinner.  He hoped for a quick reply, but didn't receive one, by the end of the day he was starting to lose hope.  A couple of days passed, and he still hadn't heard back from her since.  This didn't surprise him, he had smiled so awkwardly after all, and then there was the stupid joke "It's my briefcase" why was that even funny?  He resigned himself to the fact he had blown in and she would probably never to get in touch with him again.  Dheran didn't hold it against her, he wasn't the sort to expect women, or anyone else to like him, but he couldn't help replaying the meeting over and over again in his mind.  The only thing which offered him some temporary peace from the thoughts, was that his work had mercifully became quite hectic and so finally for the previous couple of hours his meeting with Maiya wasn't in his thoughts.  But now, here she was, calling on the very night he his message had suggested for dinner.  For some reason Dheran was afraid to answer, he took a breath and his body stiffened with trepidation as he accepted the call "No jokes" he whispered to himself as he answered.</p>

<p>"Hi Maiya" his voice almost cracked with nervousness.  "Hi Dheran, I'm so sorry I meant to call earlier", her voice rang sweetly in his ears, "been really busy, but tonight though I can make it but you didn't say a time?".  A wave of endorphins and a little panic swept over Dheran "Well whenever you like, I was hoping to have dinner ready for about seven though".  "Seven is perfect, send me your address and I look forward to seeing you then if that's still OK".  "Oh yes, yes of course" he stuttered "will do".</p>

<p>Dheran sat in a daze nodding as he planned out his next steps, he started absent mindedly shuffling his papers again as much to look like he was doing something as to play out his nervous energy whilst he thought about their conversation.  This was nothing to her, he could tell by how casual and sweet she was in the way she talked, but to Dheran this a major life event, the most important thing that had happened to him in months, at least.</p>

<p>There was no doubt Dheran's romantic life, had been a largely unsatisfactory until that point.  There had been some sporadic pleasant exceptions of course, but all too sporadic for his liking.  The last year had been an especially dry patch.  He couldn't remember speaking with any single, available people who showed the least bit of interest in him romantically.  He had been repeatedly trying to convince himself to lower his standards, but it was hard.  How could he ask someone out knowing he was lowering his standards, how would they feel about that if they knew?  There seemed to be women everywhere who at least physically met his existing standards, so he crossed his fingers, cursed his shyness, and tried to be patient.  He knew he was an overly intellectual man, and the last thing he wanted was to intellectualise himself into a relationship because he felt he should, instead he wanted passion, he wanted lust.  He couldn't settle for anything less.  Now this shimmeringly vibrant, curvaceously ripe woman had basically invited herself into his home, his life.</p>
<p>Dheran snapped out of his reverie and suddenly remembered where he was.  The office was still quiet, he felt himself clutching the papers in his fist a little too hard, "Stay calm Dheran, don't get your hopes too high, you don't even know if she's interested" he thought to himself unconvincingly.  Then he started worrying about the state of his house and whether everything was in place.  He hadn't really thought she was coming so he hadn't planned anything.  Was his house clean enough, did he have everything he needed for dinner.  The success of his forseeable love life probably depended on everything going perfectly.  Though technically there were still at least nine minutes of the work day left, amidst the excited thoughts of the evening to come, Dheran almost unconsciously slid on his jacket and picked up his bag ready to go home.  His head had barely risen above the level of the cubicle wall, his backside had only just lost contact with his chair, when a familiar voice caught his unhappy attention.</p>

<p>"Going home a little early are we Dheran?  Finished everything I presume?".  Of course it was Monique, his supervisor.  She used a tone Dheran had become wearily familiar with, a tone no doubt crafted over decades, combining mock sincerity with vague threat.  Dheran froze awkwardly between sitting and standing and guiltily stumbled over his words "Oh is it early?" he feigned, "My clock must be fast. I thought it was time.  Anyway I have to get going, a friend is coming for dinner and I need to get a couple of things. It's only a couple of minutes".  Monique arched a sculpted eyebrow, "Friend over for dinner, that's lovely isn't it?".  The volume of her voice rose as she gestured vaguely around the office "Are you saying all these other people don't have friends, family that they would like to go home to?"  "But" was all Dheran got out before she continued.  "But not they stay here and do their work, because they know they are part of a team".  She was almost shouting now.   "Perhaps leaving ten minutes early is fine for you, but if all our employees followed your example and took ten minutes off whenever they liked, then it becomes a lot of minutes very quickly doesn't it?".  "Yes of course and.." Dheran tried to speak but Monique kept going.  "And the share price of your family, this office or the Corporate City of Aquitane won't rise by you taking your friend to dinner, it will rise by working hard of your fellow colleagues.  Plenty of employees here know that and work an extra ten minutes when it's needed".  "No, but yes I stayed late on Wednes...".  "And your fellow workers, who have families and homes to take care of, whose livelihood depends on the share price, they stay here for their allotted hours and often much more".  Dheran slowly receding back into his seat, he listened, nodded and didn't bother trying to contribute to the conversation any more.  She continued in the same vein, and it was only when Dheran noticed the time had actually gone past his leaving time, that he picked up his bags, slowly got up whilst continuing to nod in agreeance and backed out of his cubicle slowly and towards the door.  She followed him, almost unaware of herself, caught in the middle of a diatribe about when she was his age or something.   He gave her one last acknowledging node and a smile he slowly opened of the door.  "I expect better from you next week Dheran" was the last audible thing he heard as the door closed, though he could still hear some muffled words until he was completely out of earshot.  He half fancied the next time he came in she would be in the same spot still continuing her rant.</p>

<h3>Corporate Cities</h3>

<p>What are called "citizens" in a corporate city would more traditionally be called shareholders, in the Corporate Cities the words effectively meant the same thing.   Instead of democracies they considered themselves meritocracies, places where rights were earned rather than given.  They were run by a group of administrators, usually called a board, which were keenly attuned to the rise and fall of prices on the market and did what they could to influence them.  Members of these boards were appointed by the shareholders, each share granting a person a vote, however the wealthiest families owned the vast majority of the shares and thus were able to pick the candidates that suited them.  In some the wealthiest families voted for themselves, and played the role in the cities of a sort of suited aristocracy, in others they stayed behind the scenes.</p>

<p>A Corporate City itself also had a share price and if some of the more powerful families weren't happy with the direction of the existing board, they could band together and drive a city's share price down to insolvency and were replaced by some competing corporation.  In some corporate cities this happened regularly, in others rarely, it largely depended on how monopolised the market was.  In cities controlled by a single family, as largely Aquitane was by a family called the Waterstones, the share price tended to be stable as the heavily controlled centralised market created stability.  It had not happened for a long time, but periodically there would be hostile buying and selling of shares between cities, a sort of economic warfare with the aggressor trying to force the price of the target city down so low they could be purchased cheaply and their resources and industries taken over.</p>

<p>People were once paid wages for their work, but now wages were seen as little more than slavery, something only the very lower rungs of society were forced to accept.  To be a citizen, to have rights, you had to be an owner, and everything within the cities could be owned.</p>

<p>People purchased or were allotted shares in the various entities they were involved in.  Whether one got a job, joined a club, married into a family, joined a school, shares would be involved.  The shares were traded on a public, centralised market open equally to all, even non citizens.  It was the value of these shares and the dividends they paid which governed the fortunes of everyone in the cities.  Philosophy may once asked what a true measure of a person was.  In the corporate cities this had a clear answer.  One knew a persons social status by a set of very public indexes of their family, workplace and other things they were involved in.  Ultimately you could even pinpoint it down to a fractional number, their current share price.</p>

<p>A corporate city just wouldn't accept anyone into them.  A person, or more usually a family wishing to live in a corporate city must either purchase the minimum shares required to feature on the share market, or be granted shares due to some useful or desirable skill they might be able to offer the Corporation.  Losing your shares, or having shares of no value for any sufficient period of time would lead to banishment beyond the city limits.  There were rings of people living outside of the city walls, many of them once proud members of families who had either individually expelled them as bad investments, or sadder cases of whole families with no share value who had been expelled en mass.  It didn't happen often, families with good connections were often able to get short term investment capital so they could prop up their share price, whilst they rebuilt.  An otherwise solid family which had just been deemed to have some bad luck were a good target for people who hoped to buy low and then ride the share price's return to profitability.  If they failed for a long time however, they would simply not be able to afford housing and supplies, they would be summoned to the central marketplace and have their citizenship rights revoked.  Even in a big city like Aquitane only one or two families a year would suffer this fate, but it would be quite the talk of the city.  The families become minor celebrities in an unfortunate way, until suddenly they were not spoken of any more.</p>

<p>Making sure those no longer welcome did not remain in a city, and that those not welcome remained outside was largely policed by specialist corporations with names like "Property Integrity Incorporated" and "Social Defence Solutions".  Most elite families owned or would have strong connections with at least one of the defence corporations of the city.  They would even often have their children work with the security corporations for a few years after completing their education.  The discipline was seen as an excellent training and hardening ground for the executives of the future.</p>

<p>Before some of the technological innovations which made the cities the bastions of security they were today, it was once common for people to live "illegally" within the city walls.  They would sometimes be hired to clean and cook for wealthy families within the city, but very often these "share-less" people were a criminal element involved in illicit activities public corporations couldn't dirty their hands with.  It was the latter element which would time from time be uncovered and the resulting scandal would rock the cities share price.  This market instability eventually led the governing boards of all the corporate cities to oust these "illegals" almost as soon as universal surveillance and monitoring made it technically possible to do so.  This hidden underclass now remained mostly in popular culture, they had been turned into something of a tale to frighten children, of people who would come in at night over the walls and commit acts of mayhem.  The useful services they provided are also forgotten and they are remembered only as those people who disturbed the peace of good corporate citizens, committed crimes and caused most of societies ills.  Every now and then rumours of people who have breached a cities defences spread, sometimes these are found to be corporate spies from other cities, sometimes they disappear and nothing is heard from them again.  By keeping crime at virtually zero and purging those unable to succeed within the corporation cities, the defence corporations keep the city share price.  As they say about a good city share price "everybody wins".</p>

<p>Now for the citizens there is a uniformity of spirit and purpose unknown in the previous ages riven by class struggle.  Those who lived in the countryside, or the social debris in margins around the cities, of course don't fare as well.  However those who lives in the corporate cities are often reminded that they are meritocracies, open to any who have the resources to buy in.  These occasions are only slightly less rare than people being evicted from the corporate cities, but on the rare occasions new corporate citizens are admitted from outside they immediately set about trying to earn respectability for themselves.  Often obsessing about finding good marriages for their children to dilute the shame of their origins.  As each generations perpetuates within the city walls, investor confidence increases proportionately, though "newcomers" can never quite rise to the status of the founding families of each the cities.  It is considered a social faux pas to ask about ancestors who may have lived outside of the city walls, and usually unnecessary because peoples connections are rarely allowed to be forgotten.</p>

<p>Wealthy cities had always had a problem with the slums around them, so much so that they bought tracts of land surrounding them to exclude the unwanted people.  With images of homes being knocked down and people being excluded from their homes, civil unrest had erupted in the country side, and the occupants of the cities suddenly realised they were a minority within a multitude.  To quell the disorder the corporate cities entered into an agreement with the representatives of those "outside", expansion would stop.  They drew up borders, signed agreements, the cities would have their land, the people outside theirs, this was the price of peace. Like most older cities, Aquitane had eventually expanded to fill their available space and the slums were once again to be found just outside the city walls.  The security corporations kept a close eye on the slums, infiltrating them as they did much of the countryside, always looking for signs of unrest.</p>

<p>Dheran lived quite close to the city walls, on a quiet night, above the dull hum or air filtration units and transporters he could sometimes hear things going on amongst the outsiders.  Traces of music, incomprehensible shouts and faint raucous laughter.  Dheran feared the outsiders, pitied them, and sometimes when he heard that laughter, wondered how anyone could be as happy as they sounded, in the midst of their desperation.  He wondered what life was really like down there.  When he was a child, during a downturn in their share price, very distant members of his family had been banished to the outer lands by the Corporate Board.  The members were far enough removed that good name of Dheran's family had survived the embarrassment and their share price had regained its value by the time Dheran was old enough to understand such things.  He was never quite clear on what had happened and the incident was never talked about in the family again, all he knew is that they were gone to an unpleasant fate.  I'm good at what I do, I'm a valued person Dheran would think to himself, it will never happen to me.</p>

<p>There was no place for luck in the philosophies of the corporate city.  "Working towards freedom" is one of the slogans of the Corporate Cities.  They described themselves sometimes as "financial meritocracies", other times as "corporate democracies", where success within the system earns a place and your power within it.  People voted with their money.  People expressed themselves through consumption.</p>

<h2>The rains</h2>

<p>Over the gentle patter of rain Dheran could hear Maiya's approaching steps well before she pressed the chime, but to maintain the necessary reserve, he stood a few moments inside the door before opening it.  Maiya clearly had no such ideas about reserve and burst in with a warm hello, a hug and a kiss that addled Dheran's attempt at playing cool.  She didn't seem to notice him somewhat dumbstruck "I love your place" she said brightly and then immediately set out on a self guided tour of Dheran's apartment.  He had little choice but to traipse around after her, whilst his mind was occupied with the glimmer of moisture her kiss had left on the side of his cheek.</p>

<p>"This is so cute" Maiya said as she flitted down the hall "I'd almost suffer through a life of conformity myself for a place like this".  "Thanks" Dheran said and then quickly gave a quizzical frown as he was trying to work through Maiya's last comment.  How did she know about his work life?  Before he had much time to think it over she said "I love it" with a look and tone so warm that Dheran felt at ease again.  He'd worked hard for his place and everything in it, partly for the very reason of being an attractive prospect for any love interest who enetered, and here it was clearly working.  Maiya disappeared into his spare room.  "Oh a guitar, do you play?" then without waiting for answer "You must play something for me".  "Of course, anytime", he went to follow her into the room but just as he got there she popped her head around the corner and asked "So what's for dinner?".</p>

<p>Dheran was unusual in the Corporate City of Aquitane in that he liked to cook.  Most people of his station and above either out out or ordered prepared meals that just had to be heated up.  Cooking was a family tradition which he had finally taken on once he got past his teenage years.  As most people whose parents are good cooks, he always wished he had learnt more from all the opportunities he had in his parents kitchen, but he was now making up for lost time and had bought a number of cookbooks as inspiration.  He had initially planned to cook something new at least once a week, but the one every two to three weeks he was actually managing still pleased him.  Though he was learning all the time wasn't yet completely at ease as a cook, his range was limited and sometimes things went very wrong.   He was apt to get distracted, mess up the cooking times, put ingredients in in the wrong order, but he was slowly learning to be more diligent about things.   He had decided to make Maiya his most interesting dish, reputedlypopular outside the city walls, which after her previous comment about "a lifetime of conformity" made him happy.  It was a mixture of lentils, vegetables and spices in a hearty brown broth, served with soft warm bread.  They ate, they talked, Dheran explained the origins of the dish, they soaked up the remaining broth with pieces of bread, Maiya said she loved it and this delighted Dheran.</p>

<p>Once they had finished Dheran thought it would be pleasant to sit outside on the balcony.  "What would you like to drink" he asked and feeling slightly guilty about the question added "Alcoholic or otherwise".  Maiya smiled and replied "I'll whatever you are having".   Dheran beckoned her to wait on the balcony "Which you missed on your tour" he added, and Maiya went outside, sitting on the large outdoor couch which took up most of the space.  Dheran turned to kitchen to get a drink, but balked at anything simple.  Things were going so well he didn't want a poor drink choice to mess it up.  He decided on the fanciest drink he knew how to make, which involved frozen watermelon, which he perpetually had in his freezer solely for this purpose, fruit, juice, and white rum blended in a tall glass with mint.  It didn't take long and he returned with a drink in each hand, giving one to Maiya he sat down next to her on the couch and held his glass up. "To new friends" he said, and then immediately regretted it.  "To good company and good food" Maiya replied clinking his glass with a giggle.</p>

<p>Dheran really liked rain, gentle rain if he happened to be out in it, but when on a mild night like this, there was something very comforting about sitting somewhere dry and watching the steady beat of rain wash away the sins of the world.  "Beautiful rain" Maiya said, as though reading his mind.  He nodded and they both listend to it for a moment.  Maiya turned to look at him "Dheran when I asked you what you did at the train station you looked a little pained".  Dheran reflexively though about his families share price, to show you weren't committed to your work wasn't something you wanted to convey.  "Oh well some days are harder than others I guess, I probably had just had a tough day".  Maiya nodded, then she said something the like of which Dheran had never heard before "Personally I think most of the work people do here in Aquitane is useless, maybe worse than useless".</p>

<p>"Well we have to work, we have to contribute to society" Dheran didn't want to spoil his prospects with Maiya for the evening, so he didn't want to be too confrontational in his reply.  Maiya looked at him, eyes wide open with sincerity "And you really think all those people in these buildings are contributing to society?  I think many of them could just stop going into work and we wouldn't be worse off, indeed we might be better off".  Dheran took a moment.  He wasn't pleased with this line of conversation, he wanted the topics of conversation to be ones conducive to wooing, and here she was diverting it to something political.  Not only that but as someone raised by his family to be a good corporate citizen, to think about the city's share price in word and deed, topics like this were almost scandalous.  The thing that unsettled him most was that somewhere on the edge of his consciousness he actually really disliked his job, it wasn't always easy for him to happily conform, but he did it, he did it for his family, he did it for the City of Aquitane, the best place to be after all.  Maiya almost sounded unpatriotic, but he didn't want the evening to go off the rails.  He thought of a tact.</p>

<p>"Maiya, do you like it here in Aquitane?"</p>

<p>"Yes of course, it is my home, my family are here. Why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Well it's the all those people working in corporations that make Aquitane what it is", Dheran preceded carefully, "Each person may not be doing something obviously useful like cleaning up rubbish or helping the sick, but they all provide services to each other.  The person cleaning up the rubbish can do it to the best of their ability without spending their time understanding how automated share trading works, that's someone else job.  All these people working together create a system that is greater than the sum of its parts.  So even if I didn't like my job, which I'm definitely not saying, I contribute to Aquitane, the best place to live in the world and I am proud to play my part, however small, in making it what it is."</p>

<p>Maiya trod carefully as well, "Well...I see the logic of that, though quite abstract. But don't you find this whole corporate city thing a little boring sometimes, cold or something. It's all so serious I feel if I don't laugh at at it occasionally I'll lose myself in it.  Do you really honestly feel that job you've been going to every day for however long is the best use of your talents, your creativity, your mind?".</p>

<p>Dheran was pierced a little by what Maiya was saying and sat silently for a moment.  This just wasn't how people talked if they wanted to maintain a good share price.  He could never admit to anyone how he felt about his work, and as he looked back at her beautiful eyes he realised he had shut out how he felt about his work even to himself.  In a few short words Maiya had conveyed to him, perhaps for the first time anyone had done so in his life, that her families share price wasn't the primary thing to care about.  He tried to come to his senses, he tried to shut the thoughts out and repeated something he'd heard coming from a screen earlier which wasn't even really a response to what Maiya had said. "Two years ago Aquitane was listed as amongst the top 10 cities for occupier investors, if I can play a part in...".</p>

<p>"Yes yes I've read the corporate advertisements too", Maiya cut him off with a laugh "My family publishes most of them". She then looked out over the balcony at the gleaming city lights and said quietly, in a voice which was as much to herself as to Dheran "Aquitane is beautiful in the rain, but still sometimes it feels like a cage to me".</p>

<p>Dheran's voice wavered with confusion "We aren't prisoners here though, we could leave any time we would like, the wall is just over there, you could leave tonight".</p>

<p>"Yes, yes I could.  I often wonder whether those walls are there to keep all the bad people out, or to keep us in.  But what about you Dheran, would you think about going out there?" as she said this she turned to look at him and her tone was so beguiling Dheran just wanted to agree "Well maybe..." she looked up into his eyes "well yes, yes I think I would like to go outside, have a look around, see it for myself".  Maiya smiled. Dhrean continued "but I don't think it's going to be very nice.  I imagine there's a reason you don't see marketing brochures for it".</p>

<p>Maiya nodded and turned back to the rain "Marketing isn't about beauty or truth Dheran, it's about occupying a little piece of your mind so someone else can use it for their own purposes".  Dheran nodded, he had no idea how to respond to that and didn't really want to.</p>

<p>"How about another drink then?".  Maiya said "Maybe a small one" and Dheran went into the kitchen.</p>

<p>Just as he turned the blender on he heard Maiya trying to say something to him.  He turned it off and asked her to repeat it "There are tours you can take outside. I would like to go and see what is like".</p>

<p>"Yes" Dheran said trying to be agreeable "That would be interesting".</p>

<p>Dheran returned with fresh drinks.  Maiya seemd to be back to smiling and polite conversation.   Again she asked him a lot of questions about himself, but less political ones.  He wanted to ask her questions back but she gave him so space to do so.  Before he knew it she was getting up and saying "I have to go now".  Dheran vainly offered another drink, but Maiya whisked herself out.  She paused at the door, and once again gave him a warm embrace and an even warmer kiss on his cheek, and then she was floating down his steps. As she trailed off into the night he called out "Oh I was going to play something on the guitar for you".  Maiya looked over he shoulder and smiled "Next time", and then with a wave she was gone.</p>

<p>Clearing up he had much to ponder.  What a beautiful woman, sweet, sparkling, but someone who said things she shouldn't say, potentially share value affecting things for her family.  He wondered what sort of family she came from, she had said they were in advertising or something.  She asked so many questions and knew so much about him, but he realised he didn't even yet know her last name.</p>

<p>He went to bed with thoughts of her still in his mind, the last thing he remembered was the feeling of her soft lips pressed against his cheek.</p>
