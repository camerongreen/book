<h2>The Waterstones</h2>

<p>One of Dheran's pleasant obligations on his work free days was to have lunch with his family.  They would congregate at his parent's home, each bringing a home made dish if they had time. They would discuss work, sport, the share price and every now and then the goings on in the wider world that might be in the news.  Dheran liked to cook but making a dish always seemed to turn out being a last minute affair, and he often bought something from a store on the way.  Due to his bachelor status the rest of the family expected this so it went without comment.</p>

<p>They were a close family.  So much so that Dheran had heard rumours their affection for one another was an act to keep the family's share price buoyant, but they were wrong.  The whole family really were exemplary corporate citizens, though Dheran always felt he had to work harder at being exemplary than the others.</p>

<p>Dheran's ancestors had managed to purchase enough shares in the city to migrate from outside the walls only a couple of generations ago, and they knew they had quite some way to go before they were completely respectable because of this.  They had done well though and prospered, all the children had decent work and the family name and share price had been for a long time been on a slow but gradually upward rise.</p>

<p>"Welcome family" Dheran's mother said warmly, once they had all assembled at the table.  She  looked out with a smile over the table laden with food and surrounded by the family's faces all turned towards her returning her smile.  Dheran couldn't help thinking the moment was almost good enough for an advertisement.  His mother gestured towards them all "We have a beautiful meal laid out before us, but before we start has anyone any news for us all that just can't wait?".  There was a general silence around the table, which was just reaching the point where Dheran's mother would usually bid them all to eat, when Dheran's sister gave him a mischievous sideways look before saying "Actually I heard Dheran had a date with a Waterstone last night".  This bought smiles and chuckles from all around the table, even a few cheers.  Dheran's face immediately reddened, "What, how?".  He looked embarrassed and perplexed to the amusement of the family.  He assumed they were talking about Maiya but he'd never actually found out her last name, families and such things weren't that important to him.  Silently with all the faces turned towards him he processed this momentous news.  That the girl he had been thinking about for every moment since she had left his presence was one of the Waterstone's, one of the most powerful families not just in this but in any other corporate city.  He turned to his sister, "but how?".  "Oh I have my ways" she gave him a teasing lingering smile and when he looked like he had suffered enough continued "but if you must know my friend works for the Waterstone's in security and told me your name was mentioned".  "Mentioned, me?" Dheran was only getting a small portion of the information.  His father intervened and said with a rosy grin "So finally we might have the last of our progeny paired off then, and with a Waterstone in the family, that would be very good for the books".  "Tell us more" was the general consensus around the table, so Dheran was forced into a brief explanation of how he met Maiya and the previous evening.  He made it very clear that they had just met and nothing was going on between them romantically.  He had been reasonably successful at calming down much of speculation when someone asked if he was going to see her again.  He made the mistake of letting slip their discussion about going somewhere together to which the crowd let out a general ooh followed by laughter.  Dheran could feel the hot blood in his face as he got more and more uncomfortable.  His mother mercifully decided they had tortured him enough however and called on the family to start eating the food whilst it was still hot, and the matter was resolved with a few final knowing glances exchanged around the table.</p>

<p>Maiya's family, the Waterstone's, were a founder family which amounted very nearly to Aquitanian royalty.  The had been signatories to its deed of incorporation and no less than four Waterstones currently held positions on the City Corporation board.  Industrious, numerous, connected, every corporation in Aquitane wished for an Waterstone on their board or in a key position.  All of Dheran's family had married well, but should Dheran come to be associated with an Waterstone, it would mean an instant boost for the family share price.  Knowing how much it might mean to his family, Dheran was reticent to talk about his immediate and powerful feelings for Maiya before he knew where it was going or if she felt the same way.  Now that word had gotten out they could all not help but be disappointed if Maiya and Dheran didn't end up as an item, especially his parents.</p>

<p>The rest of the family dinner passed relatively uneventfully, mercifully Maiya was not mentioned again.  Dheran as always stayed longer than he meant to and ate more than he should.  It was a pleasant evening and he walked home as was his habit.  Everything was quiet in Aquitane, as it generally was at this time of night.   The rain of the previous day was still in patches on the ground, and Dheran noticed the odd tree and shrub's leaves were green and upturned, almost like the rain had lifted their spirits.  As he got closer to home he walked nearer the wall and could see flames licking above from some large fire on the other side.  He heard indecipherable shouts and cackling laughter.  Chaos and noise on one side, order and quiet on the other he thought to himself.  As he detected a faint whiff of the smoke he knew where he belonged.</p>

<p>Family life was considered the centre of each corporate city.  After each family bought in to a city, their fortunes would rise and fall along with their share price, contributing to the share price of the city overall.  Dheran's family had become respectable enough that they had been grouped into a couple of investment products specialising in promising families.  Once it was announced Dheran had been offered a position within the offices of the city corporation itself, he had even attracted some direct investment.  It put unwanted pressure on Dheran to suddenly feel other people were dependent on his success, but then it was nothing his brothers and sisters had not done before him and he wanted to follow their examples.</p>

<p>Part of keeping ones share price high was making sure the public relations of the family were impeccable.  One poorly performing family member could raise suspicions about the soundness of the entire family unit, and people might even start selling their stock based on little more than rumours.  There was pressure, often self imposed, on each child in a family to tow the line, to be above reproach.  Their duty was to be exemplary corporate citizens, to show a face to the world that gave people confidence to invest.  The City Corporation ensured ideological compliance on a societal level, they advertised, they sponsored events, they promoted those who showed the talents and ideas they valued.  It was in the family unit though, where emotional ties and obligations ran deep, that the thoughts of productive corporate citizens were moulded best.</p>

<p>Part of ensuring conformance was creating a social environment that gave people common experiences.  They had specific days where everyone was expected to prove their unique affection for their mother, father, partner, or others around them, by giving them mass produced goods.  They had days to glorify those who served or died in policing the borders, in the wars of the past and to honour the corporate city of Aquitane itself.  Where once corporate cities would have as many sporting teams in the inter corporation leagues as could be financially viable, the tendency now was to have one team representing a corporate city at each particular sport, single teams that the whole city could rally around, unified to a single purpose by a slogan, song, mascot and marketing pitch.  Generally corporate citizens knew little about the world outside the walls, but they were very knowledgeable about the share prices of the local sporting teams.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of the official corporate media, ostensibly free to all citizens, was to extol the virtues of Aquitane from every line.  It's themes were on endless repeat, it was the best place to live, its citizens the most able, its history the most important, its ideals the most worthy, its sporting teams the most noble and if somehow those sporting teams didn't win it was only through bad luck or a miscarriage of justice.  The business sections might discuss Aquitane's interests in other cities and corporations, the sports sections might mention some background on Aquitane's competitors, the fashion section tried to show that Aquitane was as abreast of the latest fashion as other corporate cities, but in the day to day columns of "real" news sections, other parts of the world only reared their heads when disasters, wars and changes of leadership happened.  Often if they weren't major corporate trading partners, nothing would be heard from them regardless of what happened.</p>

<p>There was other media, it was a free press after all. One had to search to find it though as most shops only carried the well produced corporation friendly material.  The corporations would never advertise in the alternative media, and the lack of funds showed.  Not only could you tell the printing materials were of lower quality, they often cost more to buy as well, hard to justify when a shiny colourful corporate approved publication was often ostensibly free.  Few citizens bothered to read what was called "Independent Media", especially as the content demanded too much of the reader, it was often full of history, politics and philosophy.</p>

<p>Dheran had never forgotten reading one he had found on a train when he was sixteen, which detailed the descent of a small family, who bad been good corporate citizens but the parents had both fallen ill and become unable to work.  Their share price dropped rapidly, especially when the mother had eventually died, and the rest of the family were cast outside the walls, with one of their teenage children eventually falling into prostitution to feed them.  He had thought a lot about that family.</p>

<p>Dheran had been taught Corporate cities were meritocracies and if people slipped through cracks it was of their own making.  The cities were incredibly productive and as they were constantly reminded provided the highest standard of living ever known.  He knew all this but one thing he could never dismiss about that poor family though was the children.  Adults probably generally got what they deserved, but what about their children, what had they done to deserve a life outside, to be forced into prostitution when not much older than he was at the time he read it?  With all the wealth in corporate cities, surely they could do more for the people who didn't make the cut.  A child born within the wall has so much opportunity, but one on the other side had such a small chance of transcending their circumstance.  For a while after he read the article Dheran's friends and family sometimes noticed "radical thoughts" creeping into his conversation, which they would do their best to dissuade him from.  His father and mother especially sit him down on a couple of occasions talk with him about the general fairness of the way the world worked, about how their family had once come from outside the wall and made something of themselves, and that the family Dheran had read about could do the same if they were clever and worked hard.  His job was to look after his family and his future, this was the same job people outside the wall had, and that he shouldn't take other people's self inflicted troubles on his shoulders.  He remembered them saying lines he had heard before, probably at school "Beware of ideas that could distract you from realising your potential" and "The strength of a family and a society lies in a common vision" and it all made perfect sense to Dheran.  Dheran and his parents decided that it was better if he shouldn't read any more independent media until perhaps after he had finished his studies and established his career.  In fact Dheran had never read anything even slightly controversial since, but still every now and then he thought about that family.</p>

<p>Dheran was awoken gradually by one of his favourite songs, he sat listening peacefully for a moment before realising it was an incoming call from Maiya.  With a start he opened his eyes wide and reached for his phone.  He did a quick smoothing of his bed hair with one hand whilst he answered with the other.</p>

<p>"Good morning" he said, his voice croaking with night's lack of use.  "Oh are you in bed?  Did I wake you up?" Maiya sounded like someone who'd been up for hours and already done a number of productive things with her day.  Clearing his throat he lied to make her feel better "No no, I was already awake, just lying here.  What's happening?".  "Well I made some enquiries and there is a party from our company going outside later next week on a scientific mission which will include a tour of a village outside. They said we could join them if we liked".  Dheran's sleepy brain tried to process this information.  "Oh I hadn't realised you were going to plan something so soon".  "Well carpe diem Dheran" said Maiya and then added redundantly "seize the day".  Dheran was caught between fear of the unknown and the knowledge that this would be a massive escalation of their relationship.  He'd only just met this girl, he'd only just learnt her last name, and here he was about to go outside the walls with her, something he'd never done, or even thought of doing.  His attraction to her lead his thoughts "Well yes I suppose so, I guess I'll tell my parents I won't be around for dinner whatever weekend it is".  "Great" said Maiya, "well it will probably be for a couple of weekends".  "Sorry?" said Dheran, he had in mind on of the short well guarded day trips that took you out to show you a vegetable garden and drink some rustic wine and have you home in time for dinner.  "Oh I think the mission will be heading out for a couple of weeks, they haven't confirmed the exact return time yet".  "Mission?", Dheran responded, "oh but my work, I need to apply for time off and my boss won't like a whole week at short notice.  I'm pretty sure it would be out of the question".  "Oh" Maiya said without trying to hide the disappointment in her voice "that's a shame, I guess I could try to rustle up someone else".  Dheran's libido jumped into action "Oh no no, well I can ask, no harm in that, let me get back to you.".  "OK great" Maiya's voice sounded bright again "Well I have to get going" she said "Let me know about your work".  Dheran was fully awake now with many questions rolling around his mind.  Since the night she came over for dinner he had found out the momentous news that she was an Waterstone, he had no idea how to broach that subject.  He wanted to ask about the "mission", what sort of mission, it sounded awfully official, not just a quick jaunt beyond the walls.  Also he'd been a shy, single bachelor for years now and had partly resigned to that fact when this wealthy, sparkling woman had suddenly bounded into his life and seemed to have bonded with him in a couple of meetings. He really had to get ready for work though so all he said was "Sure I'll be in touch as soon as I can".  "Oh and maybe we could do dinner again, say Wednesday" said Maiya.  "Of course" said Dheran.</p>

<p>On his way to work he thought of all the ways he could ask for the time off he needed.</p>

<p>He was ready for Monique.  He was wearing his darkest suit, his most elegant tie, his hair had decided to play nice and stay in place, he had liberally applied an aftershave from a tiny bottle that had cost him a weeks dividends and promised to make him irresistible, and his shoes were shined to perfection.  He had finalised on his tactics for asking for the time off work for his trip with Maiya.  He decided on a plan that, although tricky, he thought had the best chance of success.  It was based on the duality of Monique's persona, she was a classic sociopath.  On one hand her staff knew her as an autocratic tyrant, on the other her manager thought that she a selfless supervisor who cared deeply about her staffs happiness.  When Monique said "My staff are my children" it was only the staff that rolled their eyes, the executives above Monique lapped it up.  Dheran's plan was to wait until the time was right and ask Monique in front of her executive manager, and hope that caught between her two persona's she would maintain the one which served the most powerful interest at the time.  He came up with the idea of calling them both to an important meeting, and at the end say something complimentary about Monique followed by directly asking her for the time off.</p>

<p>Unusually he arrived at work early and despite this most of his fellow employees were already there working away.  "Do these people go home?" he thought to himself half seriously as he navigated to his cubicle.  He made his way through the office carefully, hoping to avoid Monique as long as possible.  It would look suspicious to her if they met, but then Dheran waited until they were with the manager to ask her for time off.</p>

<p>As he neared his cubicle his heart sank, he could see Monique's perfectly crafted hairstyle poking up from over his cubicle divider, for some reason she seemed to be sitting on his desk waiting for him.  "Continuing the rant from before the weekend perhaps?" he thought to himself.  She hadn't seem him though so he decided he would walk away and find something else to do, when a helpful colleague greeted him loudly and thus revealed, his plan for evasion became impossible.  As he walked into his cubicle with a forced smile, he was greeting by a Monique wearing something that he had totally not expected and made him immediately uncomfortable, a shiny wide smile.</p>

<p>As unsettled as he was Dheran maintained his composure and managed a capable "Hello".  "Hello Dheran", Monique beamed back at him, "how were your allotted days off?".  "Oh good, good, saw the family, cleaned the house, that sort of thing".  "And had some time for fun I hope", said Monique in such a friendly way that Dheran was unused to and was quite frankly quite creepy.  "Yes, always enjoy time off", he said and then followed it up with "Keeps me refreshed and ready for work" to show he was a good corporate employee.  "So is there anything you need, anything to do with work that I can help you with?", she asked him.</p>

<p>Dheran was now well and truly confused.  Firstly his carefully thought out plan was in tatters and he had only been at work a few minutes.  Secondly, the supervisor sitting as his desk could not logically be the same women who had harassed him for trying to leave a few minutes early last week.  Something was up, he knew it, but on the spur of the moment he decided that he should try to roll with her out of character friendliness and ask for time off the following week.</p>

<p>"Actually Monique there was something I was going to ask you", as he asked this Monique nodded expectantly, "I was thinking of going away soon in the next week or so and I will need a few extra days off than I have in my allocation.  Now I know that there is a lot of work on at the moment, but I think I can...".  He didn't get any further when Monique interrupted "Oh met a new girl have we?".  "Well yes actually" Dheran replied, mildly surprised at her accurate guess.  "Young love, wonderful.  Of course that's fine Dheran take what you need".  He thought he'd better explain how the projects he was working on would be handled whilst he was away, but she only let him speak a few words before cutting him off again.  "Work will sort itself out, you go and have fun.  If you need to stay an extra day or two longer, just let me know and I'll make sure it gets through Human Resources".  "Oh yes", said Dheran mystified "great".  "That's all fine then, just send me the forms to sign", Monique got up, "Now I must be off, don't think I'll need to bother you again so have a great day".</p>

<p>When she left the cubicle Dhrean looked around in amazement. He then immediately sent a short message to Maiya that once she had some dates he was confident of the time off.</p>

<p>With a mix of confusion, excitement and relief, Dheran stood and looked around to his colleagues whom he thought would have overheard their conversation and be equally mystified by Monique's out of character display of benevolence.  They however were in their usual positions, frowning in concentration at their work.  One eye he did catch gave him a momentary subtle frown that seemed to say "I'm too busy to be looked at" and then went back to its pile of work without further recognition.  Again, this wasn't normal, but perhaps there was a lot of work to do, he turned to his desk expectantly looking for a pile that wasn't there.  Instead there was a note written in Monique's hand.  Specifically it said "Maiya WATERSTONE messaged you about a your trip together, please respond", and suddenly everything fell into place.  Monique may not understand normal human kindness, but she understood power.  Right now she was probably informing her managers and they were plotting how they might use it to their advantage.  If the relationship went anywhere Dheran expected they would organise a "leak" of information to the business community to give the share price a bump.  "I still barely know her" he thought to himself.</p>

<p>For the first time it really struck Dheran how important Maiya's family were, how much prestige a union with her would reflect on facets of his life.  He would be the object of quiet envy and very few people would treat him naturally, as a favourable word from him in the right Waterstone ear could change their share price.  He hadn't asked for this, he hadn't even thought about it, yet now he looked around at his frowning fellow workers, understandably unhappy with Dheran as already busy they seemed to have been allotted his work, and he realised that his life was going to be different if he dated a Waterstone.</p>

<p>Dheran wasn't one to be selfish however.  He wasn't going to accept a free ride and have his colleagues burdened with his share of the work.  He walked over to the next cubicle, and interrupted his usually jovial colleague Sanzama.  "Hi Sanzama, I see you've got the Newton account there, I did a bit of work on that last week, would you mind if I took that one?".  Sanzama raised an eyebrow, and handed him the accounts with a quizzical look.  "Thanks", said Dheran, and set about his work with an energy and diligence he hadn't known for some time.</p>

<p>Whatever happened with this strange turn of events, she wasn't a Waterstone to him, she was still just Maiya.</p>

<p>The next days went by quickly with Dheran absorbed in his work, so that Wednesday's dinner with Maiya came around soon.  Dheran's apartment was cleaner than it had been in some time, and various delicacies bubbled away on his stove.  He heard the hoped for footsteps outside his door and he couldn't help smiling.</p>

<p>Maiya looked more pleasing to him every time Dheran saw her.  Her smile was warmer, her curves more evident and beguiling, the pools of her brown eyes deeper and more fathomless.  He was ashamed of the spontaneous lust that stirred within him, lust that he was so sure she could read in his eyes that he found it difficult to look at her directly.  He really just wanted to stand and gaze at her, or hold her, though instead he said with a smile "Come in" and she pecked him the cheek.</p>

<p>"How have you been, busy?" Maiya asked.</p>

<p>"Oh no no" he lied out of convenience "Usual work.  What have you been doing?".</p>

<p>"Organising wildly!" she said triumphantly.  "Organising?".  "Our trip".  "Our trip?" Dheran repeated blindly. "So I've booked us for us to go next weekend, is that OK".  "Next Weekend?", Dheran's brain was still playing catch up.  "Is this all getting through?", Maiya looked at him with a quizzical smile.  "Yes yes, sorry, but that's soon.  I mean I know you said it would be soon, but that is really...soon".  "Is soon a problem?".  "Oh no no, no it's great, soon is great" Dheran hoped Maiya didn't detect the little bit of fear creeping into his voice.</p>

<p>The dinner didn't quite turn out as well as Dheran hoped, and he served it apologetically but Maiya ate it appreciatively.  Over dinner they discussed logistics of the trip.  Maiya explained that it was a small scientific expedition and reassured Dheran that it would be well protected.  There would be a group of scientists, some businessmen, and the rest of the party would be cooks, drivers and guards.  This sounded like a large group and taking a reasonable part of Aquitane with them allayed some of Dheran's fear of the imminent unknown.</p>

<p>After dinner the sat out on the balcony with another fruity drink and Maiya asked Dheran to play a song, which he agreed to so long as she would sing for him.  Dheran always felt most women he met could sing quite well, and Maiya was no exception.  They ended up singing a few tunes together, having another drink, and this perhaps helped Dheran pluck up the courage to ask about her family.</p>

<p>"Maiya I wanted to ask you about your family, I found out you are one of the Waterstones".  Maiya's manner softened a little as she spoke "Yes, yes, it's an interesting name to carry around.  Everyone wants to know you, everyone wants to meet your family, a lot is expected of you.  Personally I don't think I quite fit into the family, the corporate overlords and all that, it's just not me".  "So what is you" said Dheran.  "I don't know yet, I'm trying to find out".  "Do you think you might find it beyond the walls".  "Maybe" said Maiya, "Maybe not, but I know I haven't found it completely here in Aquitane.  I can't explain it really, these corporate cities just seem shallow to me, vain, unfair, cold somehow".  Dheran replied quietly, conscious that this was a conversation he wouldn't want his neighbours to overhear, word could get around after all.  "Maybe you will in time, I remember when I was a teenager I had some crazy ideas, I worried about the poor outside the walls, but the people around me took the time out to explain how things work to me.  Now I'm older I see they were right. I was youthfull idealistic, seeing the world the way I wanted it to be, not how it is.  We can't change it, we can only learn to accept it and do the best for our families".  Maiya paused and looked deeply into his eyes for a moment, "When I met you I felt I saw a hint of that questioner within you, and that was one of the things which made you interesting. I think that your younger self might have been right and the people around you were wrong.  Everything should be questioned, the corporate cities, our families.  The way we think about ourselves, the way we treat others in the world, even whether we are as free as we think we are".  Dheran was silent and for a second he wasn't sure what he thought, "But you're a Waterstone. If any family is responsible for the way this city is, it is your family. Do you think all those generations of your family, all those brilliant top executives and board members, do you think they were wrong in the way they lived their life, do you think people as powerful as them weren't free?".  "All of it is past, I don't want to judge it or them" Maiya responded "It's the future I am most interested in, and the past is just there as a lesson to help me navigate the future.  I don't want to change everything yet, I'm not sure I know enough to. But I can start somewhere, here, by changing myself.  Once I've worked myself out then maybe I'll see about the rest of the world".</p>

<p>Dheran had done it again, instead of just sticking to trite topics, maybe ones with a few jokes and ample room for flirtation, he had helped lead the conversation into deep and difficult territory.  He knew what Maiya was about to say before she did, "Well it's getting late and I better go?".  "Oh" Dheran protested "What about another drink another song.  I'm sorry I asked about your".  Maiya cut him off with a smile "No no don't worry I'm really fine talking about anything, I really do have to go, I've got a busy day tomorrow.  I'll be in touch about plans for our trip" she grabbed her things and was out the door seemingly in a moment.</p>

<p>Dheran banged the back of his head gently against the wall a couple of times after she left.  Should he have tried to kiss her when she left, or maybe when they were sitting on the balcony together.  He never quite knew what to do, in fact he seemed to have a remarkable skill for not knowing what to do.  He'd messed up everything, why did he ask her about being a Waterstone?  He couldn't care less that she was a Waterstone, why didn't he tell her an amusing story or something.  He went to bed more conscious of being alone than usual.</p>

**

<p>Dheran buried himself in his work, and the days flew by until going outside the wall seemed scarily imminent.  He recieved a few short messages from Maiya, alas nothing protesting any unbearable attraction to him, but each one made him happy that he was at least in her thoughts for a moment.  Things were going ahead and he was in a strange mixture of wanting the trip to come soon because it meant seeing Maiya, and fear and uncertainty at everything else surrounding the trip.</p>

<p>The family dinner that weekend was one of the best Dheran remembered.  He pushed himself away from the table with a sigh of content.  With his work and hobbies he often skipped meals, but every family dinner he would gorge himself.  He had outdone himself this time, he the first to start and the last to finish, to the approving eye of his mother.</p>

<p>"That was a stupendous dinner!" the defeated Dheran declared sincerely "and now I really must get going".  He rose and with a general wave and smile made for the exit with a chorus of goodbyes and other miscellaneous pleasantries following him.</p>

<p>His mother and father came see him to the door.  As they got to the door his father asked the usual questions about his work, "So how's work, heard any more about that new executive position coming up?".</p>

<p>"Yes work" Dheran replied "I've been keeping an eye on that job, just waiting for old Tyney to retire, should be within the next few months they say.  Everyone says I am a shoe in".</p>

<p>"Good, good, well you keep on working hard.  If you marry this Waterstone woman they'll want to promote you for sure" his father said trampling all over Dheran's apprehension about the topic.  "You really must bring Miss Waterstone around before you go away Dheran", his mother added apparently in an effort to make Dheran's nervousness worse.  Dheran cursed his sister once more for telling the family about Maiya.  "Well we're just friends....but if you like I will ask her, but she's very busy".  "Friends, going on a trip together.  Really, will you be sharing a tent" his mother asked.  Dheran hadn't thought about it, it was an excllent question, but he batted it off "Oh no" Dheran responded "Maiya is organising that with the company, I imagine it will all be very proper".</p>

<p>"Dheran", his father said more seriously, "Why do you want to go camping outside, you know how dangerous it can be out there.  what's out there that you can't find in Aquitane".  He didn't want to tell his father it was all Maiya's idea that he was just going along with "Oh nothing Dad, it's just a bit of fun and don't worry I'll protect Maiya from the wild animals".   "Hmm, well you be careful, it's not the wild animals that I'm worried about", his father replied with a concerned gaze. "Now now Dad, you'll get Mum worried talking like that".  His mother was already plainly worried "Why do you want to go outside the walls, that's no place to take a girl, why don't you go somewhere nice like the new hotel in the tourism district?".  "It's fine Mum, it's just a tour really, we'll be perfectly safe.  Please don't worry and I'll see you in a couple of weeks" Dheran placated her.  "OK well do as your father says and be careful and if you need anything you let us know".  Of course the family had never been camping so Dheran wasn't sure what his mother would provide if asked, but he appreciated the thought.</p>

<p>They said their final goodbyes and Dheran headed back home.  On the way he thought to himself that he didn't really like the idea of going outside either, this had all happened too fast.  But to spend time with Maiya Waterstone couldn't happen fast enough.  It was worth leaving the immaculate security of the Corporate City of Aquitane, even facing wild beasts and worse if it meant spending more time with her.  Soon it would just be the two of them, out in the open air, beneath the stars, together.  He would wait for just the right time and steal a kiss from those gentle soft lips.  Various scenarios based on this prospect of it pleasantly unsettled his mind.</p>
